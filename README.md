# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset to gain insights into the features and relationships within the data.

## Project Overview

This exploratory data analysis project aimed to:
- Identify missing values in the dataset.
- Explore and analyze numerical variables.
- Explore and analyze categorical variables.
- Investigate relationships between different features.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Tasks

### 1. Finding Missing Values

The first task involved identifying missing values in the dataset. 

### 2. Exploring Numerical Variables

In this task, i  explored numerical variables in the dataset. This included calculating basic statistics.

### 3. Exploring Categorical Variables

Categorical variables play a significant role in understanding the characteristics of the data. I analyzed categorical features utilizing bar plots and exploring their relationships with other variables.

### 4. Finding Relationships between Features

This task focuses on discovering relationships between  different features in the dataset. I  used various visualization techniques to identify patterns.
