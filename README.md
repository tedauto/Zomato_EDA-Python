# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset to gain insights into the features and relationships within the data.

## Project Overview

This exploratory data analysis project aimed to:
- Identify missing values in the dataset.
- Explore and analyze numerical variables.
- Explore and analyze categorical variables.
- Investigate relationships between different features.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Tasks

### 1. Finding Missing Values

The first task involved identifying missing values in the dataset. 

### 2. Exploring Numerical Variables

In this task, i  explored numerical variables in the dataset. This includes calculating basic statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying potential outliers.

### 3. Exploring Categorical Variables

Categorical variables play a significant role in understanding the characteristics of the data. We will analyze categorical features by generating frequency counts, bar plots, and exploring their relationships with other variables.

### 4. Finding Relationships between Features

This task focuses on discovering relationships and correlations between different features in the dataset. We will use various visualization techniques, such as scatter plots and heatmaps, to identify patterns and dependencies.
